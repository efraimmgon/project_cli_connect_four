# Your task is to build a command line Connect Four game. It should start
# with two players and render the board to the Command Line between turns.
# The board does not need to look pretty, just give enough information so
# you know its layout.

# You should validate user inputs and determine victory/loss/draw as
# dictated by the rules.
